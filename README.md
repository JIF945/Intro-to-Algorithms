# My Intro into Programming

## Overview
Recently i earned a Cert in full stack development. The class was fun & challengling. Overall the class was a great learning experience but what was taught and what i wanted to learn didnt align. So i sought out to teach and learn about the coding languages im most interested in. This is my Journey to learn about programming.
