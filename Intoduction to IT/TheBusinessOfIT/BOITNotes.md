## Testing
    Methodologies that fall within the black-box category are alpha, beta and user acceptance testing. In alpha testing, the first stage, developers and/or an internal UX team test a preliminary version of the software, providing feedback about performance and functionality. The second stage is beta testing, sometimes referred to as pilot testing. In this stage, the next version of the system is given to a segment of end users for similar testing from their perspective before the final version is released. The final stage is referred to as user acceptance testing. During this stage, the users test the system in an operational setting to make sure the system continues to align with business objectives and meet the goals of the stakeholders.
