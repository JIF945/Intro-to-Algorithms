# Programing and Scripting

## Compiler
    translates source code into machine language. A compiler checks source code for errors before translating. if the source code is found to have errors, the compiler specifies the errors. Errors must be resolved before the compiler can successfully recompile the source code. C C++, C# and java progams need compiler to execute.

## Interpreter
    interpreters translate and execute source code into machine language one line at a time. if the interpreter finds an error, the process is terminated and the statement containing the error and displays an error message. the error must be resolved before the interpreter continues to the next line. interpreters convert instructions one statement at a time when the program is run. Python, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby.
