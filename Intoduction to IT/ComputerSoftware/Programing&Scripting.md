## Compiler
    translates source code into machine language. A compiler checks source code for errors before translating. if the source code is found to have errors, the compiler specifies the errors. Errors must be resolved before the compiler can successfully recompile the source code. C C++, C# and java progams need compiler to execute.

## Interpreter
    interpreters translate and execute source code into machine language one line at a time. if the interpreter finds an error, the process is terminated and the statement containing the error and displays an error message. the error must be resolved before the interpreter continues to the next line. interpreters convert instructions one statement at a time when the program is run. Python, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby.

## Application Software
    application software consists of the programs that perform tasks specific to the machine's gerneral purpose. A computer used to maintain a store's inventory needs different software than a machine used by a mechanical engineer. Spreadsheet, database destop publishing, accounting and program development software are all examples of application software. Those who are not in the IT field might refer to application software as productivity of collaboration software or tools.

## System software
    system software performs task that are common to computer systems in general. The system software provides the infrastucture needed to run application software, allowing it to interface with the hardware of the computer system. system software can be devided into utility software and operating systems contain the user interface and the kernel of the operating system
