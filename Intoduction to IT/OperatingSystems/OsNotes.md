# Operating systems

## Types of Operating Systems
    operating systems typically come in four categories: network operating systems, server operating systems, mobile operating systems, or personal computer operating systems. Many types of operating systems are available, each with different file structures and features. 

## Operating Systems
    operating systems typically fall into one of four categories. Many Types of operating systems are available, each with different file structures and features. Three of the most common operating systems are windows, Mac and linux.
    - Windows. developed by Microsoft, inc. windows is  a closed sourced operating system, AKA proprietary software. Windows OS maintains the largest market share for server and personal computer operating systems. Typically, Microsoft products are known for their easy to use deisgn
    - MacOs.  developed by apple, Inc. MacOs is known for its media editing and graphic rendering capabilities and its ability to integreate with other apple products. 
    - Linux.  open source operating system software, which means it can be modified and distrubuted ny anyone around the world. in addition to the desktop operating systems, many distributions of linux are designed for servers.  

## Operating Systems for Mobile Devices
    - Google Android. Android is a mobile operating system that is open sourced, which allows original equipment manufactures to customize the android source code to fit their devices.
    - Apple Ios. This is the mobile operating system developed by apple for use on Proprietary apple hardware. Apple regulates all mobile apps and services that can run on IOS

## Utility Software
    utility software extends the capabilities of an operating system. Utility software helps customize the operarting system function. For example, installation utility software consists of programs for performing activities that are fundamental to computer installation but not included in the operating system. Some examples of utility software include software to compress or decompress data, play multimedia presentations, and handle newtork commnications 

## Kernel
    The kernel is the internal part of an operating system. The Kernel contains the operating system compnents that perform the basic functions required by the computer installation. One such unit is the file manager whose function is to coordinate the machines storage. The file manager records of all the files stored in secondary storage, including where each file is stored, which user have access, and which portions of the storage are available for new files.

## User interface
    the user interface allows end users to communicate with the operatiing system. command-line interfaces (CLI) are a type of user interface that communicates with end user through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor. 
    contemporary operating systems have graphical user interfaces (GUIs). GUI allow end users to issue commands through input devices such as mouses, keyboards, or touch screens. on a touch screen. on a touch screen a user can directly manipulate icons with their fingers or a stylus

## Operating Systems Users
    An operating System is also tasked with protecting the computer's resources from unauthorized users. When a computer is used by multiple people, each user is assigned their own account on the computer. A user account is a record within the operating system with information such as a name, password, and user privileges. the operating system uses the information during each log-in to control access to the system and resources. 

## Memory Management
    The Memory manage is another component of an operating system's kernel. The memory manager manages the systems's primary main memory. when a computer is performing a single task, managing the memory is minimal. when a computer is performing many taks simultaneously, the duties of the memory manager are extensive, The Memory manager needs to find and assign the main memory space for each fo the processes and restrict the actions of each process to the memory space allocated to that program. whe more main memory space is needed, the memory manager can create an illusion of additional space by roatating programs and data between the primary and secondary memory, a techique called paging. the additiional memory space created in secondary memory by paging is referred to a virtual memory.

## Device Drivers
    the kernel of an operating system stores a collection of divice drivers software that communicates with controllers of other peripheral devices. Devices drivers translate generic request inot the technical steps required to complete the task. Device drivers, sometimes referred to as middleware, facilitate the communcation of hardware and software. a print driver needs to be installed if a user wants to send a document to the printer. A Bluetooth headphone driver is necessary if a user wants to listen to music on Bluetooth headphones. Some devices drivers are installed automatically, while other would need to be downloaded and installed from the manufacturers sites. 

## Productivity Software
    Software the people use to complete daily taks is called productivity software. Productivity software is used to complete taks such as writing documents, managing personal information, giving presentations and storing data.

## Collaboration Software
    Collaboration software help people communicate and work with one another, and helps computers share information.

## Specialized Software
    Specialized software performs tasks for specific purposes. Professions such as computer-aided design, medicine, science, finance, games and entertaining use specialized software
